	<h1>Culture of India</h1>
	<p>The culture of India is one of the richest and most diverse in the world. Every state has its own language, cuisine, art forms, festivals, and customs. Indian culture celebrates life through music, dance, and color — whether it’s the joyful beats of Bhangra in Punjab, the graceful moves of Bharatanatyam in Tamil Nadu, or the festive spirit of Diwali and Holi. Respect for elders, hospitality, and togetherness are the pillars of Indian society. The blend of ancient heritage and modern progress makes Indian culture truly unique and everlasting.</p>

	<h1>Religion of India</h1>
	<p>India is the birthplace of major world religions like Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism, and it also embraces Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and many others. Religious harmony and tolerance are deeply rooted in Indian philosophy. Temples, mosques, churches, and gurudwaras stand side by side, reflecting the nation’s unity in diversity. Faith in India is not just a belief — it is a way of life that inspires kindness, peace, and spiritual growth for all.</p>

Metro systems, high-speed trains, and sustainable urban planning are shaping the new face of India. This growing infrastructure reflects India’s vision to become a global leader and a developed nation by 2047 — truly a journey from developing to developed Bharat.</p>
